# Once a functional solution to this problem has been implemented, answer the following questions.
# Q - How does this solution ensure data immutability?
# A - The data will not change becuase it can only print out data that has been declard in the array. 

# Q - Is this solution a pure function? Why or why not?
# A - It is a pure function becuase it does not rely on global variables and outputs unchanged data as it was declared. 

# Q - Is this solution a higher order function? Why or why not?
# A - No, this function is not a higher order function becuase it does not take functions as arguments or returns a function. 

# Q - Would it have been easier to solve this problem using a different programming style?
# A - No, this is a straight forward way of solving this problem. Using the intertools.chain method, which takes a list or lists and returns an iterator in an order list. 

# Q - Why in particular is functional programming a helpful paradigm when solving this problem?
# A - Becaue you can encapsulate the methods to solve the issue. OOP is not necessary in solving this problem.

# Once an Object Oriented solution has been implemented, answer the following questions:
# How does this solution demonstrate the four pillars of OOP? (It may not demonstrate all of them, describe only those that apply)
# Encapsulation
# Abstraction
# Inheritance
# Polymorphism

# Would it have been easier to implement a solution to this problem using a different coding style? Why or why not?

# How in particular did Object Oriented Programming assist in the solving of this problem?

# Reflection
# Take some time now to think about the lessons we've just covered. Prompting questions have been provided, but reflections do not need to be limited to only their answers.

# Is one of these coding paradigms "better" than the other? Why or why not?

# Given the opportunity to work predominantly using either of these coding paradigms, which seems more appealing? Why?

# Now being more familiar with these coding paradigms, what tasks/features/pieces of logic would be best handled using functional programming? Object Oriented Programming?

# Personally, which of these styles takes more work to understand? What should be done in order to deepen understanding related to this paradigm?
